We have applied the {$\lambda$}-greedy algorithm to the problem of adaptively setting trace-decay parameters in a horde architecture. We have shown that it can achieve good performance even when this predictive network is being learned over the sensorimotor data stream generated by a robot. We, therefore, conclude that the {$\lambda$}-greedy algorithm serves as a viable alternative to hand tuning these values in robotic domains.

In addition to experimenting the {$\lambda$}-greedy algorithm, we have also extended {$\lambda$}-greedy to use a direct estimate for the variance of the return. We have shown that this causes a smoother decay in the selected $\lambda$ values at the cost of a decrease in performance.
